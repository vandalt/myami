# AMI Scripts

Scripts to extract, calibrate and analyze AMI data.

- `amical_extraction.py` extracts and calibrates observables, saves in oifits
- `check_affine.py` checks if the splodge positions differ from the
  expected ones (based on AMICAL predictions).
- `amical_analysis.py` fits a binary model to the calibrated observables
